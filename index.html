        <p>I am Fiona Collins. I am a freshman at the University of Southern California studying... oh wait I actually don't know my major. I'm undecided! I really love running and triathlon and I'm planning to run LA a month from now. I also am an artist dying for my work. I grew up painting wall murals all over my room. I can show you some time ;). </p>
